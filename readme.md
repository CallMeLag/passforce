## what is the passforce project?
### the passforce project is a simple tool that uses cython and python
### to generate combinations until it matches the hash of the password


## Isint this just a brute force tool?
#### NO it is not used to brute force but to see how long it would take
#### for your own computer to find your password or whatever you type in it

## How to use in CLI
#### very simple to use in CMD or other CLI's. It only has 1 argument rn
#### which is the password so you can type the password instead (optional)
#### example: `main.py -p="password"` or `main.py --password="whatever"`
